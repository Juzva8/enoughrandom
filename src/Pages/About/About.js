            <h4>DEAR CLIENTS AND FRIENDS </h4>
            My name is <strong> 'NAME' </strong>, and I am excited to welcome you to
            Brows Jungle, LLC! 
            I honestly believe that brows can make or break any look, and my passion for what I do,
            combined with the desire to be the best, distinguishes me from other artists.
            I am a perfectionist by nature,
            and extremely detail oriented, which as a PMU is a huge advantage.
            I use innovative techniques and superior products to enhance and highlight
            my clientâ€™s natural beauty, for exceptionally gorgeous results. 
            If you are looking for a company that makes your brow satisfaction their top priority,
